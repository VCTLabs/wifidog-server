1. The client does his initial request, as if he was already connected, (e.g.: http://www.google.ca)
2. The Gateway's firewall rules mangle the request to redirect it to a local port on the Gateway. When that's the done, the Gateway provides an HTTP Redirect reply that contains the Gateway ID, Gateway FQDN and other informations
3. The Client does his request to the Auth Server as specified by the Gateway, see Login Protocol
4. The Gateway replies with a (potentially custom) splash (login) page
5. The Client provides his identification informations (username and password)
6. Upon succesful authentication, the client gets an HTTP Redirect to the Gateway's own web server with his authentication proof (a one-time token), http://GatewayIP:GatewayPort/wifidog/auth?token=[auth token]
7. The Client then connects to the Gateway and thus gives it his token
8. The Gateway requests validation of the token from the Auth Server, see Client Protocol
9. The Auth Server confirms the token
10. The Gateway then sends a redirect to the Client to obtain the Success Page from the Auth Server, redirects to http://auth_server/portal/
11. The Auth Server notifies the Client that his request was successful
